## 🧠 AI Customer Retention Intelligence — Explainable AI + GenAI System

A production-grade AI web application that identifies customer churn risk, explains why a customer may leave, and recommends personalized retention actions using Explainable AI logic and Generative AI.

This project demonstrates how real businesses use AI — not just predictions, but reasoning, decisions, and customer communication — all inside a premium, recruiter-friendly dashboard.

# 🏗️ System Architecture

User enters customer details via a premium Streamlit UI

Rule-based Explainable AI engine computes churn risk score

Risk level is classified (Low / Medium / High)

GenAI (Groq LLM) generates:

Human-readable churn explanation

Strategic retention decision

Professional customer-facing message

Results are displayed in a clean, expandable dashboard

# ✨ Project Highlights

🔹 End-to-end AI decision intelligence (not just prediction)
🔹 Explainable churn logic (transparent & interview-ready)
🔹 Generative AI for real-world retention messaging
🔹 Premium dark UI (purple-black gradient, gold typography)
🔹 Clean architecture (logic, GenAI, UI separated)
🔹 Designed for FAANG-level interviews & portfolios
🔹 Cloud-deployable with free LLM tier (Groq)

# 🧠 Problem Statement

Customer churn is one of the largest revenue killers in subscription-based businesses.

Traditional ML models predict whether a customer will leave —
but business teams need more:

• Why is the customer at risk?
• What action should we take?
• What should we say to the customer?

This project solves all three — prediction + explanation + action — using modern AI.

# 📊 Customer Input Features

The system evaluates churn risk using:

• Customer tenure (months)
• Monthly charges
• Family association (partner / dependents)
• Engagement patterns (rule-based indicators)

These features are intentionally chosen to reflect real telecom & SaaS use cases.

# 🧠 AI & Decision Logic

🔹 Explainable AI (No Black Box)

A rule-based risk engine calculates:

• Churn risk score (0–1)
• Risk category (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)
• Clear reasons influencing the score

This ensures full transparency — critical for business trust.

🔹 Generative AI (Groq LLM)

A production-ready LLM generates:

• Human-friendly churn explanation
• Strategic retention recommendation
• Polished customer communication

All responses are dynamic, context-aware, and professional.

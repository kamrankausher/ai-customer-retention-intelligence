# 🧠 AI Customer Retention Intelligence  
### Explainable AI + Generative AI Decision System

A **production-grade AI web application** that identifies customer churn risk, explains *why* a customer may leave, and recommends **personalized retention actions** using **Explainable AI logic** and **Generative AI (Groq LLM)**.

This project demonstrates **real-world AI usage** — not just prediction, but **reasoning, decision-making, and customer communication** — all inside a **premium, recruiter-friendly dashboard**.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Customer churn is one of the **largest revenue killers** in subscription-based businesses.

Traditional ML models answer:
> ❓ *Will the customer leave?*

But real businesses need:
- ❓ **Why** is the customer at risk?  
- ❓ **What** action should we take?  
- ❓ **What** should we communicate to the customer?

This project solves **all three** —  
**Prediction + Explanation + Action** — using modern AI.

---

## 📊 Customer Input Features

The churn analysis is based on:

• Customer tenure (months)  
• Monthly charges  
• Family association (partner / dependents)  
• Engagement patterns (rule-based indicators)  

These features mirror **real telecom & SaaS business logic**.

## 🧠 AI & Decision Logic

### 🔍 Explainable AI (No Black Box)

A transparent, rule-based engine calculates:

• Churn risk score *(0–1)*  
• Risk category *(LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)*  
• Clear reasons influencing the risk  

This ensures **full explainability** — critical for business trust.

### 🤖 Generative AI (Groq LLM)

A production-ready LLM generates:

• Human-friendly churn explanation  
• Strategic retention decision  
• Polished customer communication  

All outputs are **dynamic, contextual, and professional**.
